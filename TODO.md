# TODO

-   Explore through the codebase manually, and for each function call, document the created year, filename, the function name, and some notes of what it does.
-   ~~Document the flags in `build/build_config.h` file~~
-   Understand the link between header files and source files
-   Read through the chromium documentation to get a better understanding of how the different components work together
-   ~~Read through the source code to understand how the platforms call ChromeMain function~~
-   ~~Examine `base` directory~~
-   Figure out how `content/browser/browser_main_loop.cc` and `content/public/browser/browser_main_runner.h` are related to Chromium startup
